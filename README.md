# navbar-without-repear-html_js

I thought of this incredible way to repeat the navbar across pages using while using pure html,css,js. Other frameworks(rust) allow us to compartmentalize parts of the page into their own files/modules so it is easy to repeat them. I tried to do the same but while not using any framwork. I am not sure if its a common practice or if I am the rare ones who came up with this idea. But I have never seen anyone do this before. So I take credit on it, as of now.

## how it works

(I will add this later after testing out css)
